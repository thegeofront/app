# top to bottom?
Maybe im gonna make the graph from top to bottom instead of from left to right. 
3 reasons: 
- Readability: of the names of nodes
- Visualization: easy to have nodes & visualization side by side.
- Analogy to regular code (function header states input, return statement at the bottom)
(- Mobile devices)


# Why the grid & line style?
- Cartography inspired: The designers of metro network maps have discovered, over the years, that maps where **connectivity** is the most important information to convey, a certain abstract depiction with as many straight lines as possible is advantageous over maps with curves. Since both this flowchart and metro railway maps are essentially just depicting a graph, using this style seemed very appropriate.
