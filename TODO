- [X] get the setup over at this side 
- [X] figure out how to return a tuple from rust 
  -> this is hard. 
  -> option 1: make it all rust objects. They can be converted, and are fine to use when using 'inspectable'
  -> option 2: foreign objects. 
- [X] make a very dumb, basic type encoding
  - just based around string enums, and 'thrusting' that the any type contains what we need when it has 'typename'
  - TODO typechecking! 
  -> THIS IS HARD AND IMPORTANT 
  -> we cant do this naively, we will require some sort of extra ensurance that we are dealing with the right types. 

- [ ] make some sort of data import widget, or a random list of points generator 

RNG 

- [ ] return points as { buffer: Float64Array, typename: "multi-point-3"}
- [ ] return triangles as { buffer: Uint32Array, typename: "int-matrix-3"}
- [ ] return mesh as { typename: "Mesh", vertices: {... typename: MultiPoint}, triangles: {typename: IntMatrix-3}}
- [ ] visualize the shit out of it!
