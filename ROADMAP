What do we need right now? 
- types are a mess
- we are building an STD at three locations: 
  - WASM STD 
  - EXTERNAL STD
  - INTERNAL STD

We require loading a geojson, and using conditional formatting to stylize the geojson
We require clarity in the std, structure in the std, and then we can add a ton of content to the STD.
- We should add some of the logic from the geon-engine
We require better widgets, for traversing all data present
We should add support for geo


We require a clear distinction between: 
- Primitive types (number, bool, buffer) 
- Collection types (List, Object)
- Construct types (Point, Color, Polygon, ) ( Collections filled with labelled Primitives or other Collections ) -> Meaning just an object
